The repository contains a few notebooks with different variants of Newton's method for convex optimization.

1. Solving the problem
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TA x - \sum_{i=1}^n \log(x_i)$$
using Newton's method.

2.  Solving the problem
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - \sum_{i=1}^n \log(x_i)$$
subject to $Ax = b$
using Newton's method.
